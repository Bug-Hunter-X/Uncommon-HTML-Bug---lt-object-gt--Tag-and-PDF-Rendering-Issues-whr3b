<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug related to the use of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag.  The <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is used to embed external content into an HTML page, but it can be tricky to work with correctly, and there are several ways it can go wrong that are less common than other HTML errors.</p><p>Specifically, this example demonstrates a scenario where the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is used to embed a PDF file, but the <code>type</code> attribute is missing or incorrect, leading to the PDF not rendering correctly or at all.  Another uncommon error is related to incorrect MIME type specification which causes failures.</p><pre><code>&lt;object data="document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800" height="600"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your browser doesn't support embedded PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre><p>In this example, if the <code>type</code> attribute is missing, or if it's set to an incorrect MIME type, the browser may not recognize the content as a PDF and will either fail to display it or display a generic error message, which is different from most common HTML errors such as missing closing tags or incorrect nesting.</p>
